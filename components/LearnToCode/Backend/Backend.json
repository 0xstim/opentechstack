In the same way, when it comes to Backend Web Development – we primarily require a backend (or you can say server-side) programming language to make the website function along with various other tools & technologies such as databases, frameworks, web servers, etc. Pick a language from the given list and make sure to learn its quirks, core details about its runtime e.g. concurrency, memory model etc.",

Also, I would recommend learning TypeScript later on as you continue with your backend development Journey; it's a superset of JavaScript and is used in many projects.

It describes utilities, APIs, and services that a compliant OS should provide to software, thus making it easier to port programs from one system to another. A practical example: in a Unix-like operating system, there are three standard streams, 'stdin', 'stdout' and 'stderr' - they are I/O connections that you will probably come across when using a terminal, as they manage the flow from the standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). So, in this case, when we want to interact with any of these streams (through a process, for example), the POSIX operating system API makes it easier - for example, in the '<unistd.h>' C header where the stdin, stderr, and stdout are defined as 'STDIN_FILENO', 'STDERR_FILENO' and 'STDOUT_FILENO'. POSIX also adds a standard for exit codes, filesystem semantics, and several other command line utility API conventions. Visit the following resources to learn more:",

These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter. To achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important.

                "desc": "There are several ways to profile the performance of a database: Monitor system performance: You can use tools like the Windows Task Manager or the Unix/Linux top command to monitor the performance of your database server. These tools allow you to see the overall CPU, memory, and disk usage of the system, which can help identify any resource bottlenecks. Use database-specific tools: Most database management systems (DBMSs) have their own tools for monitoring performance. For example, Microsoft SQL Server has the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and the sys.dm_os_wait_stats dynamic management view, while Oracle has the Oracle Enterprise Manager and the v$waitstat view. These tools allow you to see specific performance metrics, such as the amount of time spent waiting on locks or the number of physical reads and writes. Use third-party tools: There are also several third-party tools that can help you profile the performance of a database. Some examples include SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer, Quest Software Foglight, and Redgate SQL Monitor. These tools often provide more in-depth performance analysis and can help you identify specific issues or bottlenecks. Analyze slow queries: If you have specific queries that are running slowly, you can use tools like EXPLAIN PLAN or SHOW PLAN in MySQL or SQL Server to see the execution plan for the query and identify any potential issues. You can also use tools like the MySQL slow query log or the SQL Server Profiler to capture slow queries and analyze them further. Monitor application performance: If you are experiencing performance issues with a specific application that is using the database, you can use tools like Application Insights or New Relic to monitor the performance of the application and identify any issues that may be related to the database. Have a look at the documentation for the database that you are using.",

Auth tokens work like a stamped ticket. The user retains access as long as the token remains valid. Once the user logs out or quits an app, the token is invalidated. Token-based authentication is different from traditional password-based or server-based authentication techniques. Tokens offer a second layer of security, and administrators have detailed control over each action and transaction. But using tokens requires a bit of coding know-how. Most developers pick up the techniques quickly, but there is a learning curve. Visit the following resources to learn more:",

It depends on the 'libevent' library. Memcached's APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across multiple machines.

Uniform - Choose one type of hashing algorithm, and data of any character count put through the system will emerge at a length predetermined by the program. Consistent - The algorithm does just one thing (compress data) and nothing else. One way - Once transformed by the algorithm, it’s nearly impossible to revert the data to its original state. It’s important to understand that hashing and encryption are different functions. You might use them in concert with one another. But don’t use the terms interchangeably.",

But what highlights when it comes to design is that cost and time of development and maintenance of a software should be minimum, more importantly, maintenance. Since IT industry goes through a lot of improvement and upgrades in Software, if cost and time of changing design are minimum, then it can be said it’s a good design. The reason is that it is quick with low cost to perform improvements and push for updates/upgrades. While it could be a good approach for a good design but still there is a problem associated with this, and problem is when it comes time to change design, it realize it’s too late to change design. So now again question remains what to be considered as a good design? To answer this question in a better way, let’s start subjecting design to change along way and see how design stands up? And if it doesn’t, let’s keep evolving and get closer to something which is easier to change, and this is what many experienced developers have done so far. So, software development design principles are a set of certain guidelines that are given by experienced developers which they have learned from their mistakes while they were in development phase of software.

For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw. DDD connects the implementation to an evolving model and it is predicated on the following goals: Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic; Basing complex designs on a model of the domain; Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

Event sourcing is often used in conjunction with other patterns, such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and domain-driven design, to build scalable and responsive systems with complex business logic.

It is used to manage and secure communication between microservices, and it provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and observability. In a service mesh, each microservice is typically represented by an instance of a lightweight, transparent proxy called an 'envoy'. The envoys handle the communication between microservices and provide features such as load balancing, routing, and security. Service meshes are typically implemented using a sidecar pattern, in which the envoys are deployed alongside the microservices they are responsible for. This allows the service mesh to be decoupled from the microservices and makes it easier to manage and update. Service meshes are commonly used in cloud-native architectures and are often managed using a control plane, which is responsible for configuring and managing the envoys. Some popular service mesh implementations include Istio and Linkerd. Visit the following resources to learn more:",

It is based on a set of best practices that were identified by the authors of the methodology as being essential for building modern, cloud-native applications. The Twelve-Factor App methodology consists of the following principles: Codebase: There should be a single codebase for the application, with multiple deployments. Dependencies: The application should explicitly declare and isolate its dependencies. Config: The application should store configuration in the environment. Backing services: The application should treat backing services as attached resources. Build, release, run: The application should be built, released, and run as an isolated unit. Processes: The application should be executed as one or more stateless processes. Port binding: The application should expose its services through port binding. Concurrency: The application should scale out by adding more processes, not by adding threads. Disposability: The application should be designed to start and stop quickly. Dev/prod parity: The development, staging, and production environments should be as similar as possible. Logs: The application should treat logs as event streams. Admin processes: The application should run admin/maintenance tasks as one-off processes. The Twelve-Factor App methodology is widely adopted by developers of SaaS applications, and it is seen as a best practice for building cloud-native applications that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy.

SSE is useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat systems, stock tickers, and social media feeds. It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers. To use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events. The server can then send events by writing them to the response stream with the proper formatting. Visit the following resources to learn more:",

Hardware Side: A hardware web server is a computer that houses web server software and the files that make up a website (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server establishes a connection to the Internet and facilitates the physical data exchange with other web-connected devices. Software side: A software web server has a number of software components that regulate how hosted files are accessed by online users. This is at the very least an HTTP server. Software that knows and understands HTTP and URLs (web addresses) is known as an HTTP server (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). The content of these hosted websites is sent to the end user's device through an HTTP server, which may be accessed via the domain names of the websites it holds. Basically, an HTTP request is made by a browser anytime it wants a file that is stored on a web server. The relevant (hardware) web server receives the request, which is then accepted by the appropriate (software) HTTP server, which then locates the requested content and returns it to the browser over HTTP. (If the server cannot locate the requested page, it responds with a 404 error). Visit the following resources to learn more:",

You'll only get so far with smart thinking without adding more sources to it. For a system to be scalable, there are certain things you must pay attention to, like: Coupling, Observability, Evolvability, Infrastructure. When you think about the infrastructure of a scalable system, you have two main ways of building it: using on-premises resources or leveraging all the tools a cloud provider can give you. The main difference between on-premises and cloud resources will be FLEXIBILITY, on cloud providers you don't really need to plan ahead, you can upgrade your infrastructure with a couple of clicks, while with on-premises resources you will need a certain level of planning.

                "desc": "Throttling is a design pattern that is used to limit the rate at which a system or component can be used. It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to prevent overuse of resources, such as compute power, network bandwidth, or storage capacity. There are several ways to implement throttling in a cloud environment: Rate limiting: This involves setting a maximum number of requests that can be made to a system or component within a specified time period. Resource allocation: This involves allocating a fixed amount of resources to a system or component, and then limiting the use of those resources if they are exceeded. Token bucket: This involves using a 'bucket' of tokens to represent the available resources, and then allowing a certain number of tokens to be 'consumed' by each request. When the bucket is empty, additional requests are denied until more tokens become available. Throttling is an important aspect of cloud design, as it helps to ensure that resources are used efficiently and that the system remains stable and available. It is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as auto-scaling and load balancing, to provide a scalable and resilient cloud environment.

                "desc": "Backpressure is a design pattern that is used to manage the flow of data through a system, particularly in situations where the rate of data production exceeds the rate of data consumption. It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to prevent overloading of resources and to ensure that data is processed in a timely and efficient manner. There are several ways to implement backpressure in a cloud environment: Buffering: This involves storing incoming data in a buffer until it can be processed, allowing the system to continue receiving data even if it is temporarily unable to process it. Batching: This involves grouping incoming data into batches and processing the batches in sequence, rather than processing each piece of data individually. Flow control: This involves using mechanisms such as flow control signals or windowing to regulate the rate at which data is transmitted between systems. Backpressure is an important aspect of cloud design, as it helps to ensure that data is processed efficiently and that the system remains stable and available.

                "desc": "Load shifting is a design pattern that is used to manage the workload of a system by shifting the load to different components or resources at different times. It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to balance the workload of a system and to optimize the use of resources. There are several ways to implement load shifting in a cloud environment: Scheduling: This involves scheduling the execution of tasks or workloads to occur at specific times or intervals. Load balancing: This involves distributing the workload of a system across multiple resources, such as servers or containers, to ensure that the workload is balanced and that resources are used efficiently. Auto-scaling: This involves automatically adjusting the number of resources that are available to a system based on the workload, allowing the system to scale up or down as needed. Load shifting is an important aspect of cloud design, as it helps to ensure that resources are used efficiently and that the system remains stable and available.

                "desc": "The circuit breaker design pattern is a way to protect a system from failures or excessive load by temporarily stopping certain operations if the system is deemed to be in a failed or overloaded state. It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to prevent cascading failures and to improve the resilience and availability of a system. A circuit breaker consists of three states: closed, open, and half-open. In the closed state, the circuit breaker allows operations to proceed as normal. If the system encounters a failure or becomes overloaded, the circuit breaker moves to the open state, and all subsequent operations are immediately stopped. After a specified period of time, the circuit breaker moves to the half-open state, and a small number of operations are allowed to proceed. If these operations are successful, the circuit breaker moves back to the closed state; if they fail, the circuit breaker moves back to the open state. The circuit breaker design pattern is useful for protecting a system from failures or excessive load by providing a way to temporarily stop certain operations and allow the system to recover. It is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as retries and fallbacks, to provide a more robust and resilient cloud environment. Visit the following resources to learn more:",
